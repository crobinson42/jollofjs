## Key Features

- *Convention over configuration...*
...Because you have better things to do with your time. But JollofJS is still very configurable.

- *Full support for ES6 Generators/coroutines* 
Free yourself from the oppressive/convoluted regime of callbacks and use awesome yieldables/awaitables through ES6 Promises, Generators and Co-routines. Powered by KoaJS. ES7 Async/Await coming soon.


- *Built-in Admin User Interface*
Ever wondered why something like Django Admin doesn't exist for NodeJS? Well with JollofJS, it does now.
Administer your site's data with the built-in Jollof Admin (built from scratch using React).
E.g You could whip up a blog for your Application and use Jollof Admin as a simple CMS backend for that blog.
The options are endless!

- *Environment-based Configuration Tree*
JollofJS has a custom-built config system that makes it easy to have different configurations per node.ENV.
Base configuration can easily be overwritten by environmental configs (i.e. development, test, production, etc).

- *And More!...*
