Adapters are what JollofJS uses to interface with datasources.
Data adapters are the foundations of persistent Data Reading and writing in Jollof data.

This abstraction makes it possible to use any database as a datasource for your models.
You could even create a custom adapter to use an external REST API as a datasource for said models.
